# Proton Mail Bridge in a Docker container

This is yet another unofficial Docker image to run the Proton Mail Bridge.
Use it at your own risk.
Inspired by [shenxn/protonmail-bridge-docker](https://github.com/shenxn/protonmail-bridge-docker)

## How to start

Initialize Proton Mail Bridge

```bash
docker compose run --rm protonmail-bridge bash entrypoint.sh init
login # enter your credentials
# optionally, switch to split mode if you have more that one email address
# in split mode every email address has own local credentials
# change mode 0
info 0 # View information to connect to your accounts
exit
```

Start Proton mail bridge in the background

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Fetch self-signed certificate generated by the Proton Mail Bridge
and write it into a file:

```bash
openssl s_client -showcerts \
  -connect 127.0.0.1:1143 \
  -starttls imap </dev/null 2>/dev/null |
   openssl x509 -outform PEM > cert.pem
```

# Notes on working with TLS certificates


Fetch self-signed certificate generated by the Proton Mail Bridge
and write it into a file:

```bash
openssl s_client -showcerts \
  -connect 127.0.0.1:1143 \
  -starttls imap </dev/null 2>/dev/null |
   openssl x509 -outform PEM > cert.pem
```

Example command to generate a self-signed certificate

```bash
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 \
 -days 3650 -nodes -x509 \
 -subj "/C=DE/ST=Berlin/L=Rus/O=wormi4ok/CN=protonmail-bridge" \
 -keyout ./server.key -out ./server.crt
```
